      <h2>Plant With A Purpose</h2>
      <div class="purpose">
        <p>
          We are so glad you've chosen to visit our site. We are a family owned
          company with roots planted in Denver, Colorado. All of our pots are
          handmade in the United States with materials ethically sourced from
          all around the globe.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have been involved with the gardening community for the past
          decade, and began looking for ways to positively effect environmental
          shifts. Our pots reflect our charge to create aesthetically pleasing
          products, while remaining committed to the overall sustainability of
          the planet and our brand.

      <h2>Serving the Community</h2>
      <div class="purpose">
        <p>
          Not only are we an ethically sustainable company, but Posh Pots is
          involved and passionate about community building. We use a percentage
          of our profits to fund community services that are centered around
          food resources. We also own several farms in the Denver area.
          <br />
          <br />
          A portion of our harvest is donated to the food banks in our
          surrounding communities and we share our leftover planting seeds with
          neighboring farms to increase the overall supply of crops in the city.
          We are dedicated to supporting local farmers who are supplying fresh
          fruits, vegetables, and herbs in the city.
